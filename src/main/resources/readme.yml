# There is a 6 column maximum when it comes to creating example databases.

# You can create your own MySQL database with as many tables as you would like. Then enter its details into the config file.
# Next create your own problem set inside of problems.json (make sure you keep the same json structure).
# Then load the jar by clicking on it or if that does not work run it from your command prompt. For example if its on your
# desktop you can do 'cd desktop' and then after clicking enter type 'java -jar SQLPracticeDatabase-1.0.jar'.

# You can also make your own SQLite database which does not require host, port, username, or a password. Make sure this
# file is placed in the same folder as config, settings, problems, and this readme file. Then follow the same steps as above.

# Lastly, you can instead use the provided example database and problems. This will be done in SQLite since that does not
# require a server. The example database will be made up of the tables and columns located inside the config.yml file.
# If you would like you can add or remove data to the existing tables but you cant add extra tables to it.
